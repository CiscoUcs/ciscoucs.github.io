Here we will post information on how to best run container systems on UCS.  Many people run this on the cloud, however, there is also
a number of Enterprise users who run container solutions like Mesos, Kubernetes, and Docker Swarm in their own Data Centers. While
we may be biased, but we find that half the people Cisco talks to run container solutions in their own Data Centers. 

## Docker Data Center
* [Validated design for UCS and Docker DataCenter](http://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/unified_computing/ucs/UCS_CVDs/ucs_docker.html)
* [Validated design for FlexPod and Docker DataCenter](http://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/unified_computing/ucs/UCS_CVDs/flexpod_docker_deploy_design.html)
