# Cisco UCS Developer Resources

Building this site. We created a branch: 

```
git branch gh-pages
```
Make sure it is still there: 

```
git branch
```

You should see two branches: 

```
  gh-pages
* master
```

Now just run ```publish_gitbook.sh``` and it will check in the code and publish the book.
