Here we will post information on how to best run container systems on UCS.  While we may be biased, we find half of the people who run container systems run them in their own Data Centers with the other half running them on public cloud offerings.  

## Docker Data Center
* [Validated design for UCS and Docker Enterprise Edition](http://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/unified_computing/ucs/UCS_CVDs/ucs_docker.html)
* [Validated design for FlexPod and Docker Enterprise Edition](http://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/unified_computing/ucs/UCS_CVDs/flexpod_docker_deploy_design.html)

## Kubernetes
* [KUBaM! - Kubernetes on UCS Bare Metal](/kubam/) This guide walks through automatically installing Kubernetes on UCS Bare Metal as fast as possible.
