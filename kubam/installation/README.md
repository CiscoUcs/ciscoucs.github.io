# KUBAM Installation

The base KUBAM requires a dedicated server that can either be physical or virtual.  We recommend a virtual machine with the following requirements

| Description | Requirement |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| RAM         | 4-8GB       |
| HD Space    | 20GB        |
| OS          | Linux based |

KUBAM has been tested with Ubuntu, CoreOS, and RedHat derivatives. 

KUBAM is deployed as a few containers. This gives the fastest and easiest way to install, avoids dependency hell, and makes upgrades seamless.
