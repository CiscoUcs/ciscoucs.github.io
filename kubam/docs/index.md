# KUBAM Documentation

KUBAM aims to be self explanitory but sometimes we aren't as clever as we like to think we are.  So these docs will talk about things that may seem a little mysterious to users. Also, it is a work in progress and points are documented when users have questions. 

* [Installation](kubam-node.md) Specific instructions for getting a KUBAM node up. Also how to navigate tricky installation scenarios.
* [Settings](settings.md) (SSH keys, KUBAM IP address, Proxy information)
* [Advanced Customizations](advanced-topics.md) For changing the default installation settings. 
* [Advanced Connections](connect.md) - For if your KUBAM service is behind some complicated network environment. 

## Trouble Shooting
