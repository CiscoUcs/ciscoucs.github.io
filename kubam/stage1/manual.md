For the UCS Bare Metal setup KUBaM uses vMedia Policies to do the automated installation.  This requires the following prereqs: 

* UCS Manager 2.2(2c) or higher.  (Preferably higher... come on!  Update your UCS!)
* B200 M3 or C2XX M3 servers or higher.  Servers below these models don't allow vMedia policies. 

# 1. Setup Web Server

# 2. Prepare ISO Media

# 3. Prepare boot images
