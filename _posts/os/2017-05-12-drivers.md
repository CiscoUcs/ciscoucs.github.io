You may need to update drivers for UCS if it doesn't install or recognize different components.  To make this fit with our existing automated installation we need to update the initrd.img that is included in the isolinux directory.  

Get your dependencies: 

```
yum -y install xz
```

Now modify the initrd

```
mkdir -p /install/stage/centos7.3/exploded
cp <centos7.3root>/isolinux/initrd.img /install/stage/centos7.3/
cd /install/stage/centos7.3/exploded
xz -dc < ../initrd.img | cpio --quiet -i --make-directories
```
You'll now have a file system that we need to inject. 

## Get the New Drivers Into your initrd.img

Figure out where the RPM will install the drivers: 
```
rpm -ql -p kmod-megaraid*
```

Then install the drivers: 
```
rpm -ivh kmod-megaraid_sas-07.701.16.00_el7.3-1.x86_64.rpm --nodeps
```

Copy these ko files into the right directory.  In this case we have 

```
cd /lib/modules/3.10.0-514.el7.x86_64/extra/megaraid_sas
```
Overwrite the old one: 
```
mv megaraid_sas.ko /install/stage/centos7.3/exploded/lib/modules/3.10.0-514.el7.x86_64/kernel/drivers/scsi/megaraid/
```

Pack the old image back up

```
cd /lib/stage
find . 2>/dev/null | cpio --quiet -c -o | xz -9 --format=lzma >../new_initrd.img
```
__Note:__ This command takes longer than you probably would like. 

You now have a new initrd.img that you can put into your isolinux tree for installations.
